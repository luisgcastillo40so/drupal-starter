# Drupal 8 project starter kit

This project provides a starter kit for Drupal 8 projects mixing [Drupal project template for Platform.sh](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8) and
 [Docker-based Drupal stack](https://github.com/wodby/docker4drupal) for local development environment. 

## Using as a reference

You can use this repository as a reference for your own Drupal projects, and borrow whatever code is needed. 

If you host you project on Platform.sh, I invite you to read complete informations from [Drupal project template for Platform.sh](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8) page. 

## Managing a Drupal site built with Composer

Nothing is easier than managing a Composer-based Drupal site on Platform.sh. 
See [Drupal 8 and Composer](https://docs.platform.sh/frameworks/drupal8.html) for details. 
For example adding a single module to your Drupal installation is as simple as:

```sh
composer require drupal/devel
git commit -am 'Add the Devel module'
git push
```

## How does this starter kit differ from vanilla Drupal from Drupal.org?

1. There are some differences documented on [Drupal project template for Platform.sh](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8#how-does-this-starter-kit-differ-from-vanilla-drupal-from-drupalorg).
2. We include [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file
to run useful docker containers for local development environment as described here [Docker-based Drupal stack](https://github.com/wodby/docker4drupal).
You are free to tweak it as needed for your particular environment.
sSee also [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Starting your local environment

To start your new project, you can follow the steps below:

### With Platform.sh
1. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter.git your-project-name`.
2. Run `cd your-project-name`
3. Run `platform build`. For more details [Platform.sh CLI](https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/cli.html).
4. Download Docker and run it. If your are a MacOSx user, download Docker from [Edge Channel](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac)
and uncomment `- ./:/var/www/html:delegated # With Docker Edge version` rows in your `docker-compose.yml``.  
See also [Performance tuning for volume mounts ](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/#performance-implications-of-host-container-file-system-consistency)
5. Setup your local database setting adding this code snippet in ``.platform/local/shared/settings.local.php`` file:
   ```
   $databases['default']['default'] = array (
     'database' => 'drupal',
     'username' => 'drupal',
     'password' => 'drupal',
     'prefix' => '',
     'host' => 'mariadb',
     'port' => '3306',
     'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
     'driver' => 'mysql',
   );
   ```
6. Run `make up` from your shell to build up your docker containers.
7. Open [http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/](http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/) in your browser.
8. Enjoy your brand new Drupal 8 website!

## Without Platform.sh
1. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter.git your-project-name`.
2. Run `cd your-project-name`
3. Run `platform build`. For more details [Platform.sh CLI](https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/cli.html).
4. Download Docker and run it. If your are a MacOSx user, download Docker from [Edge Channel](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#download-docker-for-mac)
and uncomment `- ./:/var/www/html:delegated # With Docker Edge version` rows in your `docker-compose.yml``.  
See also [Performance tuning for volume mounts ](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/#performance-implications-of-host-container-file-system-consistency)
5. Setup your local database setting adding this code snippet in ``.platform/local/shared/settings.local.php`` file:
   ```
   $databases['default']['default'] = array (
     'database' => 'drupal',
     'username' => 'drupal',
     'password' => 'drupal',
     'prefix' => '',
     'host' => 'mariadb',
     'port' => '3306',
     'namespace' => 'Drupal\\Core\\Database\\Driver\\mysql',
     'driver' => 'mysql',
   );
   ```
6. Run `composer install`. If you don't have *composer* installed, follow this [tutorial](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).
7. Edit `.env` file setting project variables `PROJECT_NAME` and `PROJECT_BASE_URL 
8. Run `make up` from your shell to build up your docker containers.
7. Open [http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/](http://drupal.docker.localhost:8000/) in your browser.
8. Enjoy your brand new Drupal 8 website!

## Updating Remotes
You'll need to update your git remotes to reflect that you won't be pushing to github.com with your projectâ€™s code. 
You should rename the original origin remote (the github.com [Drupal 8 project template](https://github.com/robertoperuzzo/drupal8-starter) repository) 
to 'starter' and create a new origin pointed at your bare repository.

(On your local development environment)

```
git remote rename origin starter
git remote add origin path/to/your/central/git/repo
```

To see a list of your remote repositories, run the command:

```
git remote
```

For a more detailed listing that includes the remote repositories' URLs, add a -v flag (for verbose) to the end of the command:

```
git remote -v
```
